## 📊 Optimization Strategies Overview

| 🎯 **Optimization** | ⚡ **Benefit to Compute Cores** | 💾 **Benefit to Memory** | 🛠️ **Strategies** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| 🔥 **Maximizing occupancy** | More work to hide pipeline latency | More parallel memory accesses to hide DRAM latency | • Tuning usage of SM resources such as threads per block<br>• Shared memory per block optimization<br>• Registers per thread configuration |
| 🤝 **Enabling coalesced global memory accesses** | Fewer pipeline stalls waiting for global memory accesses | Less global memory traffic and better utilization of bursts/cache-lines | • Transfer between global memory and shared memory in a coalesced manner<br>• Performing un-coalesced accesses in shared memory (e.g., corner turning)<br>• Rearranging the mapping of threads to data<br>• Rearranging the layout of the data |
| 🎛️ **Minimizing control divergence** | High SIMD efficiency (minimizing idle cores during SIMD execution) | — | • Rearranging the mapping of threads to work and/or data<br>• Rearranging the layout of the data |
| 🔄 **Tiling of reused data** | Fewer pipeline stalls waiting for global memory accesses | Less global memory traffic | • Placing data that is reused within a block in shared memory or registers<br>• Ensuring data is transferred between global memory and SM only once |
| 🔐 **Privatization** <br>*(covered later)* | Fewer pipeline stalls waiting for atomic updates | Less contention and serialization of atomic updates | • Applying partial updates to a private copy of the data<br>• Updating the universal copy when done |
| 🧵 **Thread coarsening** | Less redundant work, divergence, or synchronization | Less redundant global memory traffic | • Assigning multiple units of parallelism to each thread<br>• Reducing the "price of parallelism" when incurred unnecessarily |

## ⚖️ Tensions Between Optimizations

> *Understanding the trade-offs is crucial for optimal performance*

### 🔥 **Maximizing occupancy**
```
⚡ Benefits: Hides pipeline latency
⚠️ Risk: Too many threads may compete for cache, causing thrashing
```

### 🔄 **Shared memory tiling**
```
⚡ Benefits: Enables more data reuse
⚠️ Risk: May limit occupancy due to resource constraints
```

### 🧵 **Thread coarsening**
```
⚡ Benefits: Reduces parallelization overhead
⚠️ Risk: Requires more resources per thread, potentially limiting occupancy
```
