## 🧠 1. What's Inside a GPU? — *The Architecture Unveiled*

> 🎨 **Imagine a GPU as a highly skilled team of tiny workers doing math at lightning speed — that's the magic of parallelism.**

### 🔧 Key Components:

- **💾 Memory Dies**: Large, slowish memory (*global memory*) — where data lives.
- **🧠 GPU Unit**: The brain of the GPU, made of multiple *Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)*.

*The physical layout of a GPU card showing memory dies and GPU unit*

Looking at a GPU's physical construction, we can see it consists of memory dies (which make up the global memory) and the GPU processing unit itself, which contains all the computational elements.

### 🏗️ GPU Architecture - Fermi Example

The NVIDIA Fermi architecture features 16 streaming multiprocessors (SMs), each containing 32 CUDA cores. This design enables massive parallelism by allowing thousands of threads to execute simultaneously.

### 🔬 Inside an SM (Using Fermi as an Example):

- **32 CUDA Cores** 🧮: Do the actual calculations with float and integer processors.
- **Dual Warp Scheduler** 📋: Can issue two warps simultaneously.
- **Shared Memory (48 KB)** 🗃️: Quick team whiteboard, configurable with L1 cache.
- **L1 & L2 Caches** ⚡: Fast-access shelves (L1 is per SM, L2 is shared).
- **Registers** 🗒️: Instant personal notes for threads.

*Streaming Multiprocessor internal structure showing CUDA cores, schedulers, and memory*

### 👯‍♂️ What's a Warp?

A *warp* is a gang of 32 threads executing together in lockstep — GPU teamwork at its finest! All threads in a warp execute the same instruction at the same time, making warps the fundamental execution unit of the GPU.

*Threads execute in warps - groups of 32 threads that run in lockstep*

## 🗄️ 2. How Does a GPU Store Data? — *Memory Hierarchy Simplified*

> 🧠 "Where your data lives matters! Some spots are lightning-fast, others are sluggish."

The memory hierarchy in a GPU is crucial for performance optimization. Moving from the slowest to the fastest:

### 🍳 Kitchen Analogy:

| Storage Type      | Speed     ⚡ | Who Uses It? 👥     | Analogy 🧠                          | Size & Notes |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Registers**     | Super Fast ⚡⚡⚡ | One Thread          | Post-it note on hand 📝            | ~65,536 per SM - Fastest but limited |
| **Shared Memory** | Fast ⚡⚡     | Block Team          | Whiteboard in the room 🧻         | ~48KB per SM - Configurable with L1 |
| **L1 Cache**      | Fast ⚡⚡     | One SM              | Drawer by your desk 🗄️            | ~16KB-48KB per SM (configurable) |
| **L2 Cache**      | Medium ⚡    | All SMs             | Pantry in the kitchen 🍱           | ~512KB-4MB shared by all SMs |
| **Global Memory** | Slow 🐢      | All Threads         | Warehouse down the street 🏚️       | ~4-80GB - Largest but slowest |

### Memory Configuration Options

In the Fermi architecture, you can configure the L1 cache and shared memory allocation per SM:
- 48KB shared memory + 16KB L1 cache
- 16KB shared memory + 48KB L1 cache

This flexibility allows you to optimize for either data sharing between threads (more shared memory) or automatic caching (more L1 cache) depending on your workload.

## 💻 3. A Real GPU Example: NVIDIA GRID K520 — *Meet Your Playground*

> 💡 "Let's put theory to test with a real-world GPU example!"

The NVIDIA GRID K520 is based on the Kepler architecture (which succeeded Fermi). It's a good example of a GPU you might use for learning CUDA programming, especially as it's available in cloud environments like AWS g2 instances.

### 📊 GRID K520 Specifications:

```
🧩 Name:           GRID K520
⏱️ Clock Rate:      797 MHz
🔢 SMs:            8
📦 Shared Memory:  49,152 bytes per SM
📘 Registers:      65,536 per SM
💾 Global Memory:  ~4 GB (4,232,577,024 bytes)
👥 Warp Size:      32
👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 Threads/Block: 1,024 max
🧠 L2 Cache:       512 KB (524,288 bytes)
```

This GPU can support detailed configurations like:
- Max 2,048 threads per SM
- Memory Clock Rate: 2,500 MHz
- Maximum dimensions for thread blocks: 1024×1024×64
- Maximum dimensions for grid: 2147483647×65535×65535

![NVIDIA Kepler Architecture](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa5c825a5-3cf4-4bd8-861b-9984fe9549a7_458x594.jpeg)  
*The Kepler architecture*

🔍 Like Fermi, the Kepler architecture uses SMs (called SMX in Kepler), but with some improvements. Each SMX supports more threads, has more registers, and improved scheduling compared to Fermi SMs.

### 💡 Why This GPU Is Great for Learning:

- Available in cloud environments (no need to buy hardware)
- Has enough power for meaningful exercises
- Supports all core CUDA features
- Similar enough to contemporary GPUs to be relevant

## 🧩 4. How Does a GPU Run Tasks? — *Execution Hierarchy in Action*

> 🧱 "Divide and conquer: GPUs don't do one big thing, they do many small ones really well."

### 🏗️ GPU Execution Structure:

The CUDA programming model organizes execution in a hierarchical structure:

- **🧵 Threads**: Smallest worker units, each executing the same kernel code.
- **🔲 Blocks**: Group of threads assigned to one SM, can share memory and synchronize.
- **🌐 Grids**: Collection of blocks across the entire GPU — the whole job!

![CUDA Execution Model](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*rSVR6Hzlr0BiS6U4ohz14g.png)  
*CUDA's hierarchical organization of threads, blocks, and grids*

### 📌 Execution Flow Details:

1. Threads are grouped into blocks
2. Blocks are assigned to SMs
3. Within an SM, threads execute in warps (32 threads)
4. Multiple warps can be active on an SM at once
5. Warps are scheduled by the warp scheduler

### 📊 Execution Limitations:

The specs from our GRID K520 example show some important execution limits:
- Max 1,024 threads per block
- Max 2,048 threads per SM
- Max grid dimensions of 2147483647 × 65535 × 65535 blocks

These limitations help you structure your parallel algorithms effectively.

## 🛑 5. Speed Bump Alert! Shared Memory Bank Conflicts 😬

> 🧨 "Even fast memory can stumble when too many ask it the same thing at once."

### 🔍 What's a Bank Conflict?

Shared memory is divided into equally-sized memory modules called **banks** that can be accessed simultaneously. However, if multiple threads in a warp attempt to access different addresses in the same bank, a **bank conflict** occurs and the accesses must be serialized.

![Bank Conflicts](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_crYXd08iQ7z2ZGvXk4NqUCeA_rDRL4YYcsKTIH9KBZkywSvYTta7AS01741yyRWUXKWOxjBJ8h5Q5pW1hDB8P8tfvQB0p4VOMBggAr9PW-LTiY35kG4JN8Pg0gRwZteYFr0dBOP1QABg/s1600/4.png)  
*Bank conflicts occur when multiple threads access different addresses in the same memory bank*

For Fermi architecture:
- Shared memory has 32 banks
- Successive 32-bit words are assigned to successive banks
- Memory is organized like this:

```
Bank    |       1        |      2       |      3         |...
Address | 0  1   2   3   | 4  5  6  7   | 8  9  10   11  |...
Address | 64  65  66 67  | 68 69 70 71  | 72  73  74 75  |...
...
```

### 🔄 Three Access Patterns:
1. **Conflict-Free**: Each thread accesses a different bank
2. **Bank Conflict**: Multiple threads access different addresses in the same bank
3. **Broadcast**: All threads access the same address in the same bank (special case - no conflict!)

### ✅ How to Avoid Conflicts:

- Structure your data access patterns so threads access different banks
- If threads access successive 32-bit values, there are no bank conflicts
- Use padding to avoid stride access patterns that might cause conflicts
- Leverage the broadcast mechanism: if all threads read the same address, it's only read once

## 🧮 6. Cool New Features: Tensor Cores — *Math Gets a Boost!*

> 🤖 "Modern GPUs are smarter — meet the *Tensor Cores*, optimized for AI workloads."

### ⚙️ Tensor Cores:

- Introduced in **Volta Architecture** (after Fermi and Kepler)
- Specialized hardware accelerators for matrix operations
- Designed specifically for **matrix operations** — a key component in AI and deep learning
- Dramatically speeds up tasks like **deep learning training and inference**, **convolutions**, and other matrix-heavy computations

Tensor Cores can perform mixed-precision matrix multiply-accumulate operations in a single clock cycle — specifically designed to accelerate:

```
D = A × B + C
```

Where matrices A, B, C, and D can have different precisions (FP16 inputs and FP32 accumulation).
