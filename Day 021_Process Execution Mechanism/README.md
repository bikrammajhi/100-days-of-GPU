## 🚀 Summary

We're computing the **sum of N = 1024 × 1024 = 1,048,576 floats**, each 1.0.

we launch:

* `blocks = 4096` (each handling 256 elements)
* Within each block:

  * Threads do **warp-level reduction** (intra-warp)
  * Results from different warps are stored in shared memory
  * One warp (meta group rank = 0) reduces those results
  * Block's thread 0 writes to output

Final host sum = sum of all `output[blocks]` → should be `1,048,576`

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 Cooperative Groups Overview

Cooperative Groups gives us:

* **`thread_block`** = all threads in the block
* **`thread_block_tile<32>`** = a **warp** (32 threads)
* `warp.thread_rank()` = lane ID within a warp
* `warp.meta_group_rank()` = warp ID within the block

## 🌀 Visual Breakdown

Let’s walk through a single **block** with 256 threads:

### ✅ Step 1: **Load Input**

Each thread loads 1 element from `input[]` to a `val`:

```
block 0 (256 threads)
[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ..., 1.0] → 256 total
```

---

### ✅ Step 2: **Warp-Level Reduction**

Threads are divided into 8 warps (256 / 32 = 8)

Each warp performs:

```cpp
val = warpReduceSum(warp, val);
```

**Intra-warp sum** happens using `warp.shfl_down()`:

Each warp now has:

```
warp 0 → sum = 32
warp 1 → sum = 32
...
warp 7 → sum = 32
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: **Store Warp Results to Shared Memory**

```cpp
if (warp.thread_rank() == 0)
    warp_results[warp.meta_group_rank()] = val;
```

So:

```
warp_results[] = [32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32]
```

Only 8 threads (one per warp) write to shared memory.

---

### ✅ Step 4: **Final Warp Reduces These 8 Values**

```cpp
if (warp.meta_group_rank() == 0) {
    val = (warp.thread_rank() < blockDim.x / 32) ? warp_results[warp.thread_rank()] : 0.0f;
    val = warpReduceSum(warp, val);
}
```

Only warp 0 (first 32 threads) reads from `warp_results[]`:

* Threads 0–7: load 32
* Threads 8–31: load 0.0

Then reduce:

```
[32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 0, ..., 0] → Sum = 256
```

---

### ✅ Step 5: **Block Writes to Output**

```cpp
if (tid == 0)
    output[blockIdx.x] = val;
```

→ Each block writes 256 to output

---

## 🧮 Final Host Step

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < blocks; ++i) final_sum += h_partial[i];
```

All 4096 blocks:

```
4096 × 256 = 1,048,576 ✅
```

## 🔍 Diagram Summary (text-style)

```
[ INPUT (N = 1M) ]
 |-- BLOCK 0 -------------------------------|
 | thread 0–255: load values                |
 | 8 warps: each reduce 32 values           |
 | 8 warp sums: [32, 32, ..., 32]           |
 | warp 0 reduces them to 256               |
 | thread 0 writes: output[0] = 256         |
 |------------------------------------------|

... repeat for all 4096 blocks ...

[ OUTPUT ]
[256, 256, ..., 256]  ← 4096 entries

[ FINAL SUM ]
256 × 4096 = 1,048,576 ✅
```
