# ðŸš€ 100 Days of GPU Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of GPU** journey! This repository will serve as a public log of my learning, experiments, and projects as I dive deep into the world of GPU architecture, CUDA programming, memory hierarchies, parallelism, and acceleration for deep learning and scientific computing.

The goal is to gain both theoretical and hands-on understanding of how GPUs work and how to fully leverage their power for high-performance computing.

## ðŸ“… Progress Log

### âœ… Day 001: GPU Architecture Fundamentals

- Studied the evolution of GPU architectures: from Fermi â†’ Kepler â†’ Pascal â†’ Volta â†’ Turing â†’ Ampere.
- Learned about:
  - SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors)
  - Warp execution and scheduling
  - CUDA threads, blocks, and grids
  - Shared memory, L1, L2 caches
  - Bank conflicts and memory coalescing
  - Tensor Cores and their matrix-multiplication acceleration
