# ðŸš€ 100 Days of GPU Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of GPU** journey! This repository will serve as a public log of my learning, experiments, and projects as I dive deep into the world of GPU architecture, CUDA programming, memory hierarchies, parallelism, and acceleration for deep learning and scientific computing.

The goal is to gain both theoretical and hands-on understanding of how GPUs work and how to fully leverage their power for high-performance computing.

## ðŸ“… Progress Log

### âœ… Day 001: CPU vs. GPU Architectures & Parallelism 
- Processor Trends and Evolution
- Reviewed Mooreâ€™s Law and its impact on transistor scaling.
- Compared Latency-Oriented Design (CPU) vs. Throughput-Oriented Design (GPU).
- Deep dive into CPU and GPU design:
- History of GPUs: From graphics to general-purpose computing.
- Explored the limitations of parallelization.

### âœ… Day 002:  GPU Architecture Fundamentals 

- Wrote first 'Hello World' programme in CUDA
- Studied the evolution of GPU architectures: from Fermi â†’ Kepler â†’ Pascal â†’ Volta â†’ Turing â†’ Ampere.
- Learned about:
  - SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors)
  - Warp execution and scheduling
  - CUDA threads, blocks, and grids
  - Shared memory, L1, L2 caches
  - Bank conflicts and memory coalescing
  - Tensor Cores and their matrix-multiplication acceleration
